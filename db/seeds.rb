CBD and THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, are the two primary compounds that have been investigated in medical research.\r\n\r\nOf all of CBD’s possible applications, the one garnering the most attention is the dramatic effect it has on young patients suffering from severe forms of epilepsy. The story of Charlotte Figi, a young girl who went from 300 seizures a week to just a few with daily doses of a CBD tincture, has turned CBD into a media sensation and industry buzzword.\r\n\r\nStudies have shown CBD to have the following notable therapeutic benefits:\r\n\r\nAnti-inflammation\r\nAnti-pain\r\nAnti-anxiety\r\nAnti-psychosis\r\nAnti-spasm\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is evidence that CBD may act as a neuroprotectant – that is, able to stem neurological damage following strokes and in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s – and may play a role in neurogenesis, the creation of new brain cells.\r\n\r\nNumerous studies have shown CBD’s promise in the treatment of a wide range of conditions, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\nArthritis\r\nDiabetes\r\nAlcoholism\r\nMultiple sclerosis\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nPTSD\r\nAlzheimer’s\r\nCancer\r\nEpilepsy\r\n\r\nCBD acts on different pathways than THC in the body, complementing THC’s effects on the same symptoms when administered together.
